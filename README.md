# Smart Tent Project

This project is a smart tent monitoring system built with Arduino and IoT, using a Node.js server with Express.js to handle user authentication and a dashboard for visualizing sensor data. The dashboard provides real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, air quality, and weather conditions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up and sign in functionality.
- **Real-time Data Visualization**: Displays temperature, humidity, air quality, and weather data in real-time.
- **Weather Integration**: Fetches current weather data using the MetaWeather API.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Uses Chart.js to display data in a user-friendly manner.
- **Map Integration**: Displays the location of the tent using OpenStreetMap.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Arduino Uno with relevant sensors (Temperature, Humidity, Air Quality)
- MetaWeather API key

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-tent.git
   cd smart-tent
